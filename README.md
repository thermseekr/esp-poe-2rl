# ESP-POE-2RL
ESP32 based board with PoE, temperature/humidity sensor, and two relays. To be used for controlling loads that cannot be commanded from the main cabinet, like for example when you need a dry contact close to some equipment or appliance. The PoE power source avoids the need for additional cabling. In external control cabinets the temperature/humidity sensor will give an indication of the environment that can be adjusted switching a heater element of a fan.

A case is also available for 3D printing.
